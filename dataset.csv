"@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Olympic park bombing, weather underground, Sikh Temple shooting, etc., were all listed as terrorist acts!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values @piersmorgan by whom ?? The government or the media and the people,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
"@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Some media, but all by the government. With this President many Muslim shootings haven't been called terrorism!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values @piersmorgan i dont care about the govt !! The federal govt acknowledged that only 6% of attacks were carried out by muslims,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values @piersmorgan the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values @piersmorgan however if a person committing the same crime is NOT muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts!,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values @piersmorgan and i think this only started after 9-11 ... Not after mcveigh !! And that the media is to blame !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan 2 Muslim attacks on military bases were called work place violence!! That's STUPID!!,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values @piersmorgan but the majority !! Even you have to admit that the media is biased about this !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan After we saw the thousands of Muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders!!,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ??,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
"@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Many attacks on our embassies and other embassies, 1st twin tower attack, USS Cole, but 9-11 final straw!!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values and millions of them condemning such violence !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values how about we work the other way around two,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values lets consider the US attacks on foreign soil !! Lets consider the foreign invasions !! Irak afghanistan ...,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 What Christian attacks on schools? Where? Were they yelling Jesus is Great while they were doing it?,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values i am sorry but how many innocent american was killed during all those attacks ?? Just a fraction of the innocents killed during,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values the invasion of irak or afghanistan !! But you wont consider these innocent muslim people who were bombarded by your military !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values i ddnt see the boston bomber yelling any religious words !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values look ... Killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values but one thing we can agree on is that the western media is biased against muslims !! And consequently so are western people!!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 Where are the hundreds of Christians rioting and killing for the defilement of Christ?,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values why would they ?? As i believe they take this event proudly !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 That's funny!! They were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly!!,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values however in islam we dont depict our prophet ... If you would like to mention our prophet then at least respect our religion,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools!!,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in cold-blood at schools,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values not only at schools !! There are loads of examples !! The IRA the Norwegian attacker who killed 86 in a youth camp,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values but u r from the US and the school shootings are the most things i thought you would relate to,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence?,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values but it was never my intention to make accusations. I am merely demonstrating that psychos who kills people are everywhere,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values and not only muslims,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
"@mostafaihab96 This is true, but there are millions of Muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings!!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values not millions !! These are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values it happened before with christians with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it !!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values but now these groups have almost vanished and i believe this will happen to the few extremists !! And they r few compared,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
@acb4values to all the muslims in the world who believe in the religion of peace just like me !! Or do you think i am a terrorist ??,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
"@mostafaihab96 Actually, I would NEVER agree with that! They rarely even mention that it was a muslim attack, especially regarding Israel!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values i am just happy we agree on the same concepts !! Perhaps i am too pessimistic!! But when it comes to muslims i have seen it all,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
"@mostafaihab96 Most of MSM placates to Muslim extremist! Even this they're calling Islamaphobia, when phobia is irrational fear!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values some are really rational just like yourself whom i enjoy talking to learning how people look at us (muslims) trying to improve!,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
"@mostafaihab96 IT'S NOT irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an ""infidel""!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values but unfortunately there are also a few who would just insult me and would want to kill me !! Either way my response is the same,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
"@mostafaihab96 I appreciate that, but you do need to know that acting at all like this was justified doesn't help. You seem reasonable too!",1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@mostafaihab96 We could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better.,1,acb4values,charliehebdo
@acb4values its not justified and can never be explained and i am sorry if i gave you this impression !! Perhaps it was a misinterpretation,1,mostafaihab96,charliehebdo
